ABOUT THE SCRIPT
-----------------
- In this Script, you will learn how to generate a diff file showing you the difference between the raw HTML and the HTML after the browser has rendered it. 
- When webpages use JavaScript, the HTML rendered on the client-side is different from the raw HTML rendered on the server-side. 
- Creating a diff will allow you to see how the browser views your webpage. This is great for SEO applications.\
- We will be using repl.it to run this script

HOW TO USE IT
---------------
- If you are pasting the code from github into your own repl, create the following files in your repl
	- html.txt
	- renderhtml.txt
	- diff.html
- Click on the repl.it link (https://repl.it/@AnirudhTatavar1/HTML-Diff#main.py) to open the code on your browser. You can edit this code however you would like. 
- Click the green “run” button at the top of the screen and wait for the required installations to finish.
- When you see the prompt to enter a URL, simply right click on the console and paste your code. Then hit enter in order to generate the diff.
- Once you see the “Done!” message, click on the three dots next to “Files” and “download as zip.” 
- Open the zip file and click on the “diff.html” file. This should open up the diff file on your browser. 
- You are finished! (Oftentimes the HTML is large so you may need to scroll horizontally to see both parts of the diff file). 

VIEWING THE DIFF
-----------------
- On the left side of the diff, you will see the raw HTML and what has been removed (highlighted in red)
- On the right side of the diff, you will see the rendered HTML and what has been added (highlighted in green)
