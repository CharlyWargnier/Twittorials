## ABOUT THE SCRIPT

* In this Script, you will learn how to generate a **visual diff file** showing you the difference between the raw HTML (coming from the server) and the rendered HTML after JavaScript changes. 
* When webpages use JavaScript, the HTML rendered on the client-side can be different from the raw HTML rendered on the server-side. 
* Creating a visual diff will allow you to see client-side only changes. This is **great for JavaScript SEO**.
* We will be using **repl.it** to run this script

## HOW TO USE IT

* Click on the [repl.it link](https://repl.it/@AnirudhTatavar1/HTML-Diff#main.py) to open the code on your browser. You can edit this code however you would like. 
* If you are pasting the code from github into your own repl, create the following files in your repl
  * html.txt
  * renderhtml.txt
  * diff.html
* **Click the green “run” button** at the top of the screen and wait for the required installations to finish.
* When you see the prompt to enter a URL, **simply right click on the console and paste your URL**. Then hit enter in order to generate the diff.

* Once you see the “Done!” message, click on the three dots next to “Files” and **“download as zip.”** 
* Open the zip file and click on the “diff.html” file. This should open up the diff file on your browser. 
* **You are finished!** (Oftentimes the HTML is large so you may need to scroll horizontally to see both parts of the diff file). 

## VIEWING THE DIFF

* On the left side of the diff, you will see the **raw HTML** and what has been removed (highlighted in red)
* On the right side of the diff, you will see the **rendered HTML** and what has been added (highlighted in green)
* **Note:** (You may need to scroll far to the right of the diff file in order to view the right half)
